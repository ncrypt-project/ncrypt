/**
 * `nCrypt` needs to be initialized with a set of random data before it can be
 * used.
 * <br />
 * If `nCrypt` seems to be more than buggy, not working at all, throwing 
 * exceptions at nearly any function, check if it was initialized. (If it was
 * and still barely anything works, it probably runs in an outdated or 
 * incompatible environment, like an incompatible browser.)
 * <br />
 * Using `nCrypt` and it's dependencies without initialising with random data
 * is - if it "works" - anything but secure! Cryptographic security often
 * depends on good random values.
 * <br />
 * There are several ways to **obtain random data for `nCrypt`**. However, they
 * tend not to be the same for all browsers and NodeJS. To abstract generating
 * random data, `nCrypt` uses `randomCollector` as a  dependency. 
 * <br />
 * `randomCollector` supports collecting random data both in browser
 * and NodeJs, from built-in random generators or (in browser) from user 
 * interaction (i.e. mouse or touchmove). 
 * <br />
 * `randomCollector` is available from `nCrypt.dep.randomCollector`. To use
 * `randomCollector` without `nCrypt`, use the package 
 * `ncrypt-random-collector`.
 * @param {Uint32Array} buf - An instance of `Uint32Array` filled with
 * cryptographically random data. `nCrypt` needs at least 1024 bit of random
 * data, but usually, initialising with 4096 bit makes sure everything works
 * smoothly. 4096 bit of random data equals an array length of 128 items, each
 * containing a random unsigned `Int32` integer number. (4096 bit / 8 = 512 
 * byte, each `Int32` can represent 4 bytes, 512/4 = 128.)
 * @returns {boolean|SecureExec.exception.Exception} - Returns `true` if 
 * `nCrypt` was initialised properly, and `false` if it wasn't. (If `false` is
 * returned, check arguments and try again with an `Uint32Array` containing 
 * enough random data.)
